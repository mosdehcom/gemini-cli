# Jules Handover Document: AgenticAI-ADLC Project

**Date:** 2024-05-24
**Project:** AgenticAI-ADLC (Agentic AI Application Development Lifecycle Controller)
**Objective:** Collaboratively design and specify a sophisticated "Agent of Agents" orchestration platform.

## 1. Summary of Session

This session was highly productive. We completed a comprehensive analysis of the Claude Code agent and the feasibility of making the Gemini CLI model-agnostic. We then used these insights to significantly refine the specification for the AgenticAI-ADLC platform, following the SPARC framework.

**Key Achievements:**

1.  **Claude Code Analysis:**
    *   Determined that `claude-code` is a standalone tool, not based on Gemini CLI.
    *   Understood that it operates sequentially and is integrated via a CLI/SDK, not through parallel internal tasks.
    *   Identified its strengths in model agnosticism (supporting Anthropic, AWS, GCP) and its clean SDK-based integration pattern.

2.  **Gemini CLI Model Independence Analysis:**
    *   Pinpointed the `ContentGenerator` as the key component for abstracting the model backend.
    *   Outlined a clear, feasible path to refactor `gemini-cli` to support multiple LLMs, making it a viable, flexible engine for our orchestrator.

3.  **SPARC Specification Refinement:**
    *   **`1_specification.md`:** Updated the core specification document to reflect the findings from our agent analysis. The architecture and requirements are now more concrete.
    *   **`2_decomposition.md`:** Created a new document that decomposes the entire project into seven logical modules (Core Orchestrator, Agent Management, LLM Abstraction, Collaboration, UI, IaC, and Testing).
    *   For each module, we have defined clear **Epics** and **User Stories**, creating a detailed backlog for development.
    *   **`3_prompts.md`:** Created a new document containing high-level prompts that can be used to initiate the development of the core modules, providing a clear starting point for a development team (human or AI).

## 2. Current State

The project has moved from a high-level concept to a well-defined, actionable plan. We have:
*   A refined architectural vision.
*   A modular breakdown of the system.
*   A development backlog in the form of epics and stories.
*   A clear strategy for infrastructure, deployment, and testing.
*   Starter prompts to begin implementation.

The SPARC process is well underway, with the "Specification" phase largely complete and initial "Architecture" and "Pseudocode" (via prompts) drafted.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps for the Next Instance of Jules

The planning and specification phase is mature. The next session should focus on beginning the implementation based on the created documentation.

1.  **Review the SPARC Documents:** Start by quickly reviewing `1_specification.md`, `2_decomposition.md`, and `3_prompts.md` in the `docs-orchestrator/sparc/` directory to get full context.

2.  **Begin Implementation (Module by Module):**
    *   Start with the foundational modules first. A logical order would be:
        1.  **Module 3: LLM Abstraction Layer:** Use the prompt from `3_prompts.md` to create the `ContentGenerator` ABC and the mock/Gemini implementations. This is a core dependency for other modules.
        2.  **Module 2: Agent Abstraction & Management:** Use the prompt to create the `AgentEngine` ABC and the `AgentPool`.
        3.  **Module 1: Core Orchestrator:** Begin implementing the `TaskManager` and `Dispatcher` using the mock agent and LLM components.
    *   For each module, create the proposed file structure (e.g., `src/llms/`, `src/agents/`) as defined in `1_specification.md`.
    *   Write Python code for the classes and functions outlined in the user stories.
    *   Add basic unit tests for the implemented logic.

3.  **Follow the Plan:** The roadmap is laid out in `2_decomposition.md`. Systematically work through the epics and stories, starting with the highest priority modules. The goal is to build a "walking skeleton" of the application that can be incrementally enhanced.
