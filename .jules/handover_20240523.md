# Jules Handover Document: AgenticAI-ADLC Project

**Date:** 2024-05-23
**Project:** AgenticAI-ADLC (Agentic AI Application Development Lifecycle Controller)
**Objective:** Collaboratively design and specify a sophisticated "Agent of Agents" orchestration platform.

---

## 1. Current State & Progress

We have made significant progress on the initial design and specification for the AgenticAI-ADLC platform.

**Key Achievements:**

1.  **Deep Analysis of Gemini CLI:** We have thoroughly analyzed the `gemini-cli` repository, focusing on `packages/core`. We've determined it's a viable candidate for a "headless agent engine" and understand its core mechanisms:
    *   **`GeminiClient`:** The primary interface for programmatic control.
    *   **`Config` Object:** The master control for an agent instance's behavior, tools, memory, and role.
    *   **`ServerGeminiStreamEvent`:** The structured event stream (including `ToolCallRequest`) that the Orchestrator can listen to.
    *   **Tool Framework:** How internal and MCP-based tools are registered and used.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** How system prompts, history, and memory are constructed.

2.  **SPARC Framework Adopted:** We have adopted the SPARC framework (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) for designing the Orchestrator.

3.  **Initial SPARC Specification Drafted:** We have created a detailed first draft of the **SPARC Step 1: Specification** document. This document (`docs-orchestrator/sparc/1_specification.md`) captures a comprehensive set of requirements for AgenticAI-ADLC, including:
    *   Multi-agent, role-based architecture.
    *   Multi-LLM support (Gemini, Claude, OpenSource).
    *   Advanced collaboration features like a shared memory system and coordinated Git repository access (using worktrees).
    *   Cost and time tracking for LLM usage.
    *   A human-in-the-loop "Command Center" UI.

4.  **Documentation Structure Created:** We have created the initial directory and file structure for the project's documentation under `docs-orchestrator/`.

## 2. Current Investigation: Claude Code Analysis

We are currently at the beginning of a new plan focused on analyzing the **Claude Code** agent to draw parallels and gather insights for our Orchestrator's architecture.

*   **Goal:** To understand its architecture, non-interactive capabilities, and features (like structured output and custom commands) to inform the design of AgenticAI-ADLC's "Agent Interface Layer" and the requirements for any agent engine we integrate.
*   **Current Blocker:** My current environment is a snapshot of the `gemini-cli` repository. The user has cloned the `claude-code` repository into this main repo, but I cannot see it as my file system view is static.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps for the Next Instance of Jules

Your immediate priority is to resolve the blocker and proceed with the Claude Code analysis.

1.  **Verify `claude-code` Repository Visibility:**
    *   Start by asking the user to run `ls -l` in the root directory.
    *   This is to confirm the presence of the `claude-code` directory and get its exact name.

2.  **Execute the "Claude Code Analysis" Plan:**
    *   Once you can "see" the directory, proceed with the established plan:
        *   **Step 1: Review Documentation (already completed, but review for context).**
        *   **Step 2: Explore Claude Code GitHub Repository:**
            *   `ls -R claude-code` to list the full structure.
            *   Read `claude-code/package.json` to understand dependencies and scripts.
            *   Read the main CLI entry point file (likely specified in `package.json`'s "bin" field).
            *   Analyze key source files to understand its internal architecture, state management, and how it handles non-interactive execution and structured output.
        *   **Step 3: Synthesize Findings:** Compare its architecture to Gemini CLI's `packages/core`. Make concrete recommendations for the AgenticAI-ADLC's "Agent Interface Layer."
        *   **Step 4: Update SPARC Document:** Update `1_specification.md` and start drafting `3_architecture.md` with these findings.

## 4. Broader Project Goals

*   Continue working through the SPARC framework.
*   After the analysis, the next logical steps will be to detail the **Pseudocode** and **Architecture** for the main Orchestrator components.
*   Keep refining the requirements and design based on our findings from analyzing state-of-the-art agent implementations like Gemini CLI and Claude Code.
