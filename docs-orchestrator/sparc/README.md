# SPARC Development Framework for AgenticAI-ADLC

This section details the development of the AgenticAI-ADLC platform using the SPARC framework.

## SPARC Steps:

1.  **[Specification](./1_specification.md)**: Defines the project's goals, functional and non-functional requirements, user scenarios, and UI/UX guidelines.
2.  **[Pseudocode](./2_pseudocode.md)**: Outlines the high-level logic for orchestrator components and agent interactions.
3.  **[Architecture](./3_architecture.md)**: Describes the system's structure, technology stack, and component interactions.
4.  **[Refinement](./4_refinement.md)**: Documents iterative improvements and optimizations to the design.
5.  **[Completion](./5_completion.md)**: Covers deployment plans, user documentation, and finalization.

Each step will include detailed content and a "Reflection" subsection discussing decisions, alternatives, and potential challenges.
