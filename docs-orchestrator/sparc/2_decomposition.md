# SPARC Step 2: Decomposition, Epics, and Stories

This document breaks down the AgenticAI-ADLC platform into logical modules, defining epics and user stories for each to guide development.

## Module 1: Core Orchestrator

This is the heart of the system, responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of a task.

*   **Epic 1.1: Task Management**
    *   **Story 1.1.1:** As a User, I can submit a high-level task description through a REST API so that the system can begin processing it.
    *   **Story 1.1.2:** As the System, I can receive a task and assign it to a Planner Agent for decomposition.
    *   **Story 1.1.3:** As a Planner Agent, I can analyze a task and break it down into a dependency graph of sub-tasks.
    *   **Story 1.1.4:** As the System, I can store and manage the state of the task and its sub-task graph (e.g., in a database).

*   **Epic 1.2: Workflow & Dispatch**
    *   **Story 1.2.1:** As the System, I can monitor the sub-task graph and identify which tasks are ready to be executed (i.e., their dependencies are met).
    *   **Story 1.2.2:** As the System, I can match a ready sub-task to an appropriate agent based on the required role.
    *   **Story 1.2.3:** As the System, I can dispatch a sub-task to an available agent from the agent pool.
    *   **Story 1.2.4:** As the System, I can receive the result of a completed sub-task and update the state of the task graph.

## Module 2: Agent Abstraction & Management

This module deals with creating, managing, and interfacing with different types of AI agents.

*   **Epic 2.1: Generic Agent Interface**
    *   **Story 2.1.1:** As a Developer, I can define a clear, abstract interface that all agent "engines" must implement (e.g., `execute_task(prompt, tools)`).
    *   **Story 2.1.2:** As a Developer, I can create a concrete adapter for the refactored Gemini engine that implements the generic agent interface.
    *   **Story 2.1.3:** As a Developer, I can create a concrete adapter for the Claude Code SDK that implements the generic agent interface.

*   **Epic 2.2: Agent Pool Management**
    *   **Story 2.2.1:** As the System, I can create and manage a pool of agent instances based on configuration.
    *   **Story 2.2.2:** As the System, I can track the status of each agent in the pool (e.g., idle, busy, error).
    *   **Story 2.2.3:** As the System, I can configure agent roles with specific system prompts, tools, and LLM models.

## Module 3: LLM Abstraction Layer

This module ensures the system is not tied to a single LLM provider.

*   **Epic 3.1: Model-Agnostic Content Generation**
    *   **Story 3.1.1:** As a Developer, I can define a generic `ContentGenerator` interface with methods like `generate_content`, `count_tokens`, etc.
    *   **Story 3.1.2:** As a Developer, I can implement a `GeminiContentGenerator` that uses the Google Gemini API.
    *   **Story 3.1.3:** As a Developer, I can implement a `ClaudeContentGenerator` that uses the Anthropic Claude API.
    *   **Story 3.1.4:** As a Developer, I can implement an `OpenAIContentGenerator` for OpenAI-compatible APIs (which can be used for many open-source models).

## Module 4: Collaboration & Workspace

This module provides the infrastructure for agents to work together effectively.

*   **Epic 4.1: Shared Context & Memory**
    *   **Story 4.1.1:** As an Agent, I can save key-value information and unstructured text to a shared memory system associated with my current high-level task.
    *   **Story 4.1.2:** As an Agent, I can query the shared memory using keywords or semantic search to retrieve relevant context.

*   **Epic 4.2: Version Control Coordination**
    *   **Story 4.2.1:** As the System, upon starting a new task, I can create an isolated Git worktree or feature branch.
    *   **Story 4.2.2:** As the System, I can provide the correct Git context (branch/worktree path) to the agents working on a task.
    *   **Story 4.2.3:** As an Agent, I can use `git` tools provided by the orchestrator to commit my changes to the correct branch.

## Module 5: Command Center UI & API

This module provides the human interface to the system.

*   **Epic 5.1: API Development**
    *   **Story 5.1.1:** As a Frontend Developer, I need a REST API endpoint to submit new tasks.
    *   **Story 5.1.2:** As a Frontend Developer, I need a REST API endpoint to view the status of all ongoing tasks.
    *   **Story 5.1.3:** As a Frontend Developer, I need a REST API endpoint to drill down into a specific task and see its sub-task graph and agent interactions.

*   **Epic 5.2: UI Development**
    *   **Story 5.2.1:** As a User, I can see a dashboard of all active and recent tasks.
    *   **Story 5.2.2:** As a User, I can click on a task to see a visual representation of its sub-task workflow.
    *   **Story 5.2.3:** As a User, I can inspect the conversation log for any given sub-task to understand how the agent made its decisions.
    *   **Story 5.2.4:** As a User, I can approve or reject steps that require human-in-the-loop validation.

## Module 6: Infrastructure & Deployment (IaC)

This module focuses on creating a robust, repeatable, and cloud-agnostic deployment strategy.

*   **Epic 6.1: Containerization**
    *   **Story 6.1.1:** As a DevOps Engineer, I can define a Dockerfile for the main orchestrator application.
    *   **Story 6.1.2:** As a DevOps Engineer, I can use Docker Compose to define the local development environment, including the orchestrator, a database, and any other required services.

*   **Epic 6.2: Cloud-Agnostic IaC**
    *   **Story 6.2.1:** As a DevOps Engineer, I can use Terraform (or a similar tool) to define the core infrastructure required to run the application.
    *   **Story 6.2.2:** As a DevOps Engineer, I can create separate Terraform modules for cloud-specific resources (e.g., for GCP, AWS, Azure) to keep the core infrastructure definition generic.
    *   **Story 6.2.3:** As a DevOps Engineer, I can define a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to a target cloud environment.

## Module 7: Testing Strategy

This module defines the approach to ensure the quality and reliability of the platform.

*   **Epic 7.1: Unit & Integration Testing**
    *   **Story 7.1.1:** As a Developer, I will write unit tests for all critical functions in the orchestrator, agent adapters, and LLM wrappers.
    *   **Story 7.1.2:** As a Developer, I will write integration tests to verify that the core components (Task Manager, Dispatcher, Agent Pool) work together correctly.

*   **Epic 7.2: End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
    *   **Story 7.2.1:** As a QA Engineer, I can define E2E test scenarios that simulate a user submitting a real-world task.
    *   **Story 7.2.2:** As a QA Engineer, I will create a test suite that runs these E2E scenarios against a deployed instance of the application, using mock LLM APIs to ensure predictable results and control costs.
    *   **Story 7.2.3:** As a QA Engineer, the E2E test suite will validate that the correct files are created/modified and that the final output matches the expected outcome.
