# Project: AgenticAI-ADLC (Agentic AI Application Development Lifecycle Controller)

## 1. Overview

This documentation covers the **AgenticAI-ADLC** project, a sophisticated orchestration platform designed to manage and coordinate a team of specialized AI agents. The primary goal is to automate and assist in the complete application development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and architecture to coding and deployment.

This platform is architected to be a flexible "Agent of Agents," supporting multiple Large Language Model (LLM) backends (including commercial and OpenSource models), enabling advanced multi-agent collaboration, and providing robust tools for human oversight and interaction.

## 2. Main Sections

*   ### [SPARC Development Framework](sparc/README.md)
    *   **[1. Specification](sparc/1_specification.md)**: Defines the project's goals, functional and non-functional requirements, user scenarios, and UI/UX guidelines.
    *   **[2. Pseudocode](sparc/2_pseudocode.md)**: Outlines the high-level logic for orchestrator components and agent interactions.
    *   **[3. Architecture](sparc/3_architecture.md)**: Describes the system's structure, technology stack, and component interactions.
    *   **[4. Refinement](sparc/4_refinement.md)**: Documents iterative improvements and optimizations to the design.
    *   **[5. Completion](sparc/5_completion.md)**: Covers deployment plans, user documentation, and finalization.

*   ### [Agent Engine Analysis](agent_engine_analysis/README.md)
    *   **[Gemini CLI Core Integration](agent_engine_analysis/gemini_cli_core.md)**: Deep dive into using `packages/core` as a headless agent engine.
    *   **[Claude Integration & Capabilities](agent_engine_analysis/claude_integration.md)**: Analysis of Claude as an agent engine, focusing on structured output and code generation workflows.
    *   **[Multi-LLM Abstraction Layer](agent_engine_analysis/llm_abstraction.md)**: Design for supporting various LLM backends.

*   ### [Design Decisions & Q&A](design_decisions.md)
    *   A running log of key architectural decisions, alternatives considered, and answers to important design questions.
